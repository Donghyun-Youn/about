I am majoring in IC design, graduating at Aug. 2025.
I am highly self-motivated and deeply interested in devising efficient solutions to various problems and learning from the process.

My research interests include:
+ Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits
+ Sensor Interface Integrated Circuits
+ Wireless Communications
I am on the lookout for internship opportunities in IC design.
Should you require any assistance or have questions, please feel free to contact me.

Also, I hold great respect for all individuals committed to learning.

I look forward to connecting with you.
Thank you!
