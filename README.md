I am an IC designer, as a member of [IMPACT Lab](https://impact.kaist.ac.kr/) with 35+ graduate students and 14+ research projects.<br>
I have enjoyed discussions with them to experience broad range of applications and circuit blocks, <br>
**being proficient in**<br>
1) analog/mixed-signal IC designs<br>
2) mathematical analysis on their behavior or noise model.<br>

**During my Ph.D. degrees, I led six successful tape-outs**, designing following circuits:
+ Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) & Oscillators
+ Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR, ΔΣM)
+ RF Transmitter<br>

**which are implemented in diverse process nodes**:
+ TSMC 180nm GP
+ Global Foundry 130nm LP
+ TSMC 65nm GP
+ TSMC 55nm ULP
+ Samsung 28nm LPP<br>

I am on the **lookout for internship opportunities in IC design**,<br>
and **<span style="color:blue">being on-site at San Francisco in Feb. 2025 to present my paper in ISSCC</span>**.

If you are requiring any assistance or interested in my experience, please **feel free to reach me**.<br>
I would be happy to tell you the details and dive into discussions.<br>

I look forward to connecting with you.<br>
Thank you!<br>
