I am an IC designer, as a member of [IMPACT Lab](https://impact.kaist.ac.kr/) with 35+ graduate students and 14+ research projects.
I have enjoyed diving into discussions with them to experience broad range of applications and circuit blocks.

During my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, I led six successful tape-outs, designing following circuits:
+ Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) & Oscillators,
+ Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR, ΔΣM),
+ RF Transmitter,

which is implemented in diverse process nodes:
+ TSMC 180nm GP
+ Global Foundry 130nm LP
+ TSMC 65nm GP
+ TSMC 55nm ULP
+ Samsung 28nm LPP
