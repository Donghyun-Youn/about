I am an IC designer, as a member of [IMPACT Lab](https://impact.kaist.ac.kr/) with 35+ graduate students and 14+ research projects.<br>
I have enjoyed discussions with them to experience broad range of applications and circuit blocks,<br>
being proficient in **1) analog/mixed-signal IC designs** and **2) mathematical analysis on their behavior or noise model**.<br>

**During my Ph.D. degrees, I led six successful tape-outs**, designing following circuits:
+ Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) & Oscillators
+ Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR, ΔΣM)
+ RF Transmitter<br>

**which are implemented in diverse process nodes**:
+ TSMC 180nm GP
+ Global Foundry 130nm LP
+ TSMC 65nm GP
+ TSMC 55nm ULP
+ Samsung 28nm LPP<br>

If you are interested in my works, please feel free to reach me.  I will be happy to tell you the details and dive into discussions.
